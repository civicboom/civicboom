Template: cb-website-web/backends
Type: string
Default: localhost:5000
Description: What is the location of the backend servers?
 A space-separated list of backends to use, with each backend being "host:port".
 For a developer, with all packages installed on one desktop /
 laptop, the default should be fine.

Template: cb-website-web/caching
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Should the web server cache static data?
 The live server should cache data for performance, but it can be a pain
 when debugging

Template: cb-website-web/timing
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Should nginx log timing information?
 Nginx can be set to log the amount of time it takes upstream (eg. pylons) to
 generate a page and the time it takes downstream (eg. the browser) to get it;
 however, this makes the log format non-standard, so it gets put into a
 separate log file, which takes up more disk space.
