Template: cb-website-api/db_main
Type: string
Default: postgresql://civicboom:civicboom@localhost/civicboom
Description: Where is the main database?
 There should only be one main database in the cluster; this will be where
 the cb-website-db package is installed. Developers running everything on
 one desktop / laptop can leave this setting (and the next few) as default.

Template: cb-website-api/db_geo
Type: string
Default: postgresql://civicboom:civicboom@localhost/civicboom_gis
Description: Where is the GIS database?
 Since the GIS data is pretty much static, there can be many copies of
 the database -- pick one which is close and not overloaded.

Template: cb-website-api/db_log
Type: string
Default: postgresql://civicboom:civicboom@localhost/civicboom_log
Description: Where is the log database?
 Currently we only support one log database per cluster. In the future
 it should be possible to have multiple log keeping nodes, and any one
 of those could be picked, but for now, just point to the central one.

Template: cb-website-api/mc_session
Type: string
Default: 127.0.0.1
Description: Where is the session cache?
 This should be the host:port of a memcachedb server which can be used
 for storing session data. A regular memcache server could be used,
 however that would mean that when the memcache server goes down everybody
 is logged out.

Template: cb-website-api/mc_cache
Type: string
Default: 127.0.0.1
Description: Where is the memcache server?
 This should be a space-separated list of host:port pairs for a
 set of memcache servers. For the cache to work efficiently, all
 the API nodes need to have exactly the same list (even the same
 order)

Template: cb-website-api/worker_queue
Type: string
Default: 127.0.0.1
Description: Where is the worker queue?
 Currently a Redis server, though that may be different in future
