Here are some words that are never used on their own in templates, but
might be dynamically generated on their own -- thus no translation is
automatically created but one is needed:

${_("_user")}
${_("_User")}
${_('_group')}
${_('_Group')}
${_("_free")}
${_("_Free")}
${_("_article")}
${_("_Article")}
${_("_assignment")}
${_("_Assignment")}
${_("_request")}
${_("_Request")}
${_("_free")}
${_("_plus")}
${_('_users')}
${_('_groups')}
