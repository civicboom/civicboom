<h1>Notification Settings</h1>

<p>You can manage your messages and notifications through these settings. If you only want to be notified through your Civicboom profile but not through email please amend accordingly.</p>
<p>You also have the option of not being notified at all (although we don't recommend this!). You can change these settings at any time.</p>
