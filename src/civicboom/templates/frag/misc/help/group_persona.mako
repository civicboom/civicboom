<h1>Group persona</h1>
<p>This is your group persona and all members of the group have access to it. A group behaves in the same way as a user - but it represents a specific issue, topic, theme, brand, publication, project etc. All requests and responses are set under the banner of the group.</p>

<p>${_('The group also has a _widget associated with it. The _widget holds a list of all your requests and can be embedded on a specific page or website empowering your community to respond directly to requests set by that group.')}</p>
