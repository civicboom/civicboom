<li>Third Party Advertisements
<br>Civicboom may allow other companies called “third-party ad servers” or “ad networks” to serve advertisements
within this Website.  These third-parties may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements
and links that appear on this Website.  They will automatically receive your IP address when this happens and they
may employ other technologies such as cookies to measure the effectiveness and/or personalise the advertisements.
Any Data received from a third party ad server in relation to your account will be handled in accordance with this
Privacy Policy.
<br>Civicboom will not provide your personal information to third party ad servers without your consent, except as
a part of a Website feature which you as a Member will have the option to opt out of before such disclosure.
<li>Use of cookies
<br>The use of cookies is common in the computer industry. A cookie is data sent to your computer by a Web server
that records your actions on a certain Web site. When you visit the site again after being sent the cookie, the site
will load certain pages according to the information stored in the cookie. We use cookies in two ways:
<ol>
<li>Per-session cookies: These are used while Members are logged on to the Website and when Users visit the Website
to help us monitor traffic through the Website and do not store any personal information; and
<li>Auto logon cookies: These store some personal data in order to allow Members to log on automatically when you
visit the Website.
<br>With most web browsers it is possible to configure your Internet browser so that it can refuse new cookies, prompt
you to accept a cookie or disable cookies altogether.  How you do this will depend on the Internet browser you use
(For example Internet Explorer 7, Netscape, Firefox).  By refusing to accept Civicboom’ cookies our Website will not
operate correctly.  For further details on cookies we recommend that you visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
<br>Cookies relating to this Website will be stored on your computer. Unless otherwise indicated, auto logon cookies
will be stored on Members’ computers for a period of one month.

prospective purchasers, their advisers and new owners of the business.  We will handle the transfer of your data securely
in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<li>Protecting Your Information
<br>Internet security is not absolute; therefore, security controls are built into the Website to offer you a greater
degree of protection. We also keep your Data confidential subject to the purposes for which the details were collected.
The internal procedures of the Data Controller cover the storage, access and disclosure of your data.
<li>Updating Personal Information

Website Terms and Conditions.  If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place
notices on other pages of this Website, so that you may be kept informed of the Data we collect and how we use it at
all times. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes.
<br>Owing to the global nature of the Internet infrastructure, the Data you provide may be transferred in transit to
countries outside the European Economic Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your Data and
its use as set out in this Privacy Policy.  By submitting your Data, you consent to these transfers and agree that
