    <div class="legaltext">Civicboom may allow other companies called “third-party ad servers” or “ad networks” to serve advertisements
    within this Website.  These third-parties may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements
    and links that appear on this Website.  They will automatically receive your IP address when this happens and they
    may employ other technologies such as cookies to measure the effectiveness and/or personalise the advertisements.
    Any Data received from a third party ad server in relation to your account will be handled in accordance with this
    Privacy Policy.</div>
    <div class="legaltext">Civicboom will not provide your personal information to third party ad servers without your consent, except as

    <div class="legaltext">4. Use of cookies</div>
    <div class="legaltext">The use of cookies is common in the computer industry. A cookie is data sent to your computer by a Web server
    that records your actions on a certain Web site. When you visit the site again after being sent the cookie, the site

    <div class="legaltext">4.1 Per-session cookies: These are used while Members are logged on to the Website and when Users visit the Website
    to help us monitor traffic through the Website and do not store any personal information; and</div>
    <div class="legaltext">4.2 Auto logon cookies: These store some personal data in order to allow Members to log on automatically when you
    visit the Website.</div>
    <div class="legaltext">With most web browsers it is possible to configure your Internet browser so that it can refuse new cookies, prompt
    you to accept a cookie or disable cookies altogether.  How you do this will depend on the Internet browser you use
    (For example Internet Explorer 7, Netscape, Firefox).  By refusing to accept Civicboom’ cookies our Website will not
    operate correctly.  For further details on cookies we recommend that you visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</div>
    <div class="legaltext">Cookies relating to this Website will be stored on your computer. Unless otherwise indicated, auto logon cookies
    will be stored on Members’ computers for a period of one month.</div>

    in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</div>
    <div class="legaltext">6. Protecting Your Information</div>
    <div class="legaltext">Internet security is not absolute; therefore, security controls are built into the Website to offer you a greater
    degree of protection. We also keep your Data confidential subject to the purposes for which the details were collected.
    The internal procedures of the Data Controller cover the storage, access and disclosure of your data.</div>
    <div class="legaltext">7. Updating Personal Information</div>

    notices on other pages of this Website, so that you may be kept informed of the Data we collect and how we use it at
    all times. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes.</div>
    <div class="legaltext">Owing to the global nature of the Internet infrastructure, the Data you provide may be transferred in transit to
