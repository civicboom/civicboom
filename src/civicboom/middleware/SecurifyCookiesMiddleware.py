Workaround for beaker's insecure cookie settings


Beaker has a config-time on/off setting for secure cookies, where
we want it to be secure if possible and insecure as a fallback.

--> https://bitbucket.org/bbangert/beaker/issue/63


Also, there is no way to set httponly, to protect against XSS
cookie theft.

If there is a "Cache-Control: public" header, then strip the
"Set-Cookie" header -- otherwise proxies could cache the
set-cookie, and all users behind the proxy would get the
same session ID
