<h2>Things common to all requests:</h2>

<section>
<h3>Transport</h3>
<ul>
<li>All content-modifying actions (POST, PUT, DELETE) require an _authentication_token
    argument; since this is universal, it isn't mentioned in the docs for each action
    separately. The token can be found by calling /account/signin.json / xml
<li>Cookies are used to keep track of sessions
<li>PUT and DELETE can be emulated with POST, having the form variable "_method" set
    to PUT or DELETE respectively
<li>HTTP status codes are used:
    <ul>
      <li>200 - generic success
      <li>201 - content created
      <li>400 - generic user error (commonly missing required data when submitting a form)
      <li>403 - permission denied
      <li>404 - content not found
      <li>500 - generic server error
      <li>501 - not implemented
      <li>502 - back-end server is down for maintenance
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Data formats</h3>
<p>Formats can be added to the end of the URL; for instance while /messages/42
will show you message #42 in a browser-friendly way (HTML), a standalone app
may prefer /messages/42.json or /messages/42.xml

<p>JSON data format:
<pre>
{
    "status": "ok" / "error",                              (required)
    "message": "string to show in app status bar / popup", (string or None, should be there if status = error)
    "data": {                                              (required; blank dictionary if there is no data)
        "foo": "bar", # function-specific data
        "baz": "qux"
    }
}
</pre>

<p>XML is pretty much the same, just in XML
